# Gate Transformer QGIS plugin
### Modify geometry of pedestrian movement gates in space syntax

## About
Gate Transformer is a plugin to modify the geometry of gates used in space syntax movement observations.
Gates are usually drawn perpendicular to the axial line, with varying lengths. For presentation of movement observations the typical output is a map showing lines along the axial lines to indicate the movement direction. The gates should all be rotated 90degrees and have the same length.

## Installation
The plug-in can be installed from the QGIS Plugins Manager, and updates become automatically available once submitted to the QGIS plugins repository.

## Software Requirements
QGIS (2.0 or above) - http://www.qgis.org/en/site/
